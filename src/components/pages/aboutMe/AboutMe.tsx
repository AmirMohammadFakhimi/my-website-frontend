                    I hope your day has been fantastic so far. Allow me to introduce myself. I

                    city of Kashan, Iran. That makes me {getBold(String(getAge()))} years old and brimming with

                <p className={'about-me-paragraph'}>
                    My journey began in Kashan, where I completed my high school education
                    at {getLink('Shahid Beheshti (Ehsan) High School', 'http://www.beheshtikasch.ir')}. However, my
                    thirst for
                    knowledge and passion for technology led me to pursue my dreams further afield.

                <p className={'about-me-paragraph'}>
                    For my university education, I ventured to Tehran, Iran, where I was fortunate enough to be accepted
                    into the prestigious {getLink('Sharif University of Technology', 'https://en.sharif.edu')} (the best
                    university in Iran, according
                    to {getLink('QS ranking 2023', 'https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2023')}).
                    Here, I delved headfirst into the world of {getBold('Computer Engineering')}, driven by my love for
                    coding and machine learning. I've honed my skills in various programming languages,
                    including {getBold('C')} and {getBold('Java')},
                    and immersed myself in the captivating realms of {getBold('Machine Learning')}.

                <p className={'about-me-paragraph'}>
                    In the development arena, I've developed a keen interest in {getBold('iOS development')}, taking on
                    several projects to challenge and expand my skills. In the research sphere, I'm deeply fascinated by
                    Machine
                    Learning, particularly in the domains
                    of {getBold('Natural Language Processing')}, {getBold('Computer Vision')},
                    and {getBold('Deep Learning')}.

                <p className={'about-me-paragraph'}>
                    One pivotal moment in my journey was when I secured a spot in
                    the {getLink('Rahnema College summer boot camp', 'https://rahnemacollege.com')} in
                    2022. There, I had the opportunity to acquire a wealth of knowledge, with a particular highlight
                    being my involvement in the {getBold('Frontend')} development of
                    the {getLink('final project', 'https://github.com/Rahnema-College-SU/Football-Fantasy-FrontEnd')}.
                    This experience added
                    another layer to my skill set and fueled my thirst for growth.
